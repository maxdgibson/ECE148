## Group repository used for our final autonomous vehicle parking project.

Our project was intended to use aruco marker detection and lidar obstacle avoidance in order to
navigate our car through a parking garage and park it in open spaces.

These files show the different iterations and versions we used to control our robot. Our initial goal was to use ROS2, with OAK-D Lite and LIDAR, but we decided to just use the Aruco detection and control the robot using PyVesc without ROS. The final file we used to get results is called `Aruco_VESC_Final.py`
